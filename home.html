      <br/> My name is Shelby (Shi Yutao), a 22-year-old boy. I'm from Ningbo City of College Technology. My major is computer application technology. Two years' study in the school gave me a comprehensive understanding of computer application technology.<br/>
 I am an open-minded person who accepts the guidance of my predecessors and the criticism of my superiors. It is a rare quality that I will change my mistakes. During my spare time and part-time job, I learned that people should be diligent, motivated, patient, know how to start from an early age, do every job well, and enrich their professional knowledge and expand their knowledge, so that they can do things with ease. <br/>　　
 I am a young man with a wide range of interests. I like dancing, listening to music, reading books, sports, handcrafting, painting and so on. Although I am not proficient in each of these skills, I can shape myself from many aspects, and be more optimistic. When I do something, I will come and go, not forgetting the beginning, not seeking the end, and accepting the world with a smile! I just spare two or three days a week to do physical exercises, such as jogging and badminton. It's not useless.<br/> 
The world is a small place. I've also made some like-minded friends, and I've gradually become talkative on certain occasions, and I've heard things I didn't know before. So whether I do things or understand them, I believe I can start from a new aspect and gradually become more comfortable in doing things. 　　<br/>
