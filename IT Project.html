    I will introduce IT project, online survey system, which I want to develop in the future. It can be used in many places, such as customer satisfaction, product quality and customer feedback, etc. Through the data fed back by the system, we can make corresponding corrections to the company's products and services to help the company achieve better development.

  Enterprises depend on their customers, so they should understand the current and future needs of customers, meet their requirements and strive to exceed their expectations. Nowadays, the quality management system widely implemented in the world can help enterprises improve customer satisfaction. For example, customers require products to meet their needs and expectations. In any case, the acceptability of products is finally determined by customers. However, customers' needs and expectations are constantly changing at any time. Customers' satisfaction at that time does not mean that they will all be satisfied later. If customers ask for satisfaction, enterprises will already be in a passive position, and there will inevitably be neglected aspects. To take the initiative, enterprises must know the changing customer needs and expectations through regular and irregular customer surveys, and constantly improve products and the process of providing products, so as to be truly customer-centered.</br>
  The IT project I want to develop, the online survey system, can just be used for customer survey. Through the data fed back by the system, the company's products and services can be corrected accordingly to help the company achieve better development.
